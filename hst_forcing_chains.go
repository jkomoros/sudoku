	 * Conceptually this techinque chooses a cell with two possibilities
	 * and explores forward along two branches, seeing what would happen
	 * if it followed the simple implication chains forward to see if any
	 * cells end up set to the same number on both branches, meaning
	 * that no matter what, the cell will end up that value so you can set it
	 * that way now. In some ways it's like a very easy form of guessing.
	 *
	 * This techinque will do a BFS forward from the chosen cell, and won't
	 * explore more than _MAX_IMPLICATION_STEPS steps out from that. It will
	 * stop exploring if it finds one of two types of contradictions:
	 * 1) It notes that down this branch a single cell has had two different numbers
	 * implicated into it, which implies that somewhere earlier we ran into some inconsistency
	 * or
	 * 2) As soon as we note an inconsistency (a cell with no legal values).
	 *
	 * It is important to note that for every sudoku with one solution (that is, all
	 * legal puzzles), one of the two branches MUST lead to an inconsistency somewhere
	 * it's just a matter of how forward you have to go before you find it. That means
	 * that this technique is sensitive to the order in which you explore the frontiers
	 * of implications and when you choose to bail.
