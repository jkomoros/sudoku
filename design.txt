dokugen must be able to solve Sudoku itself to be able to generate them.

A simple BFS of statespace on constraints should be fastest. But to get difficulty, we'll need to solve as a human does.

We'll have a fastSolve, which uses a constrained BFS, and a humanSolve, which proceeds knowing a grid can be solved and returns a difficulty.

Grids are passed back and forth over channels. They should be easily serializable and small whenever possible, but still be fast for common operations. You may read and write to them only if you have a ref, and you can only get a ref via a channel.


Grid {
	data string
	cells Cell[DIM * DIM]
}

TODO:

*Right now finite_queue is slower than it should be and more complicated. Instead, each bucket should have a randomized flag if it's been shuffled. The queue should have a currentBucket property. Whenever a new item is added, we remove that currentBucket. When we want an item and don't have a currentBucket, we walk upwards until we find a bucket with something. If it's not ranodmized, we call shuffle. Then we keep it. Then when we want an item we just slice it off the front. There are no nils in the middle.

* Investigate why using the finite queue isn't making a big dent in Fill() performance.
* Reduce memory usage in cell: row, col, block are rarely asked for so can be derived?

* There's a leak somewhere in solve or fill. If you fill 500000 grids it runs out of memory.

* Some way to quickly copy queues and then enforce that all gets come from a copy; this will be useful for solver techniques which require a clean queue.
	* Queues have Getters that each consume the underlying data individually. Each queue has an insertionCounter variable that is updated whenever an insert happens. Each getter remembers the insertNumber it is keyed to; if it ever changes it throw out its work and starts again (keeping its ignoreMap the same). Each getter has an ignoreMap that it uses to ignore items it has already seen. Each time it switches to a new bucket it makes a copy of the bucket that has no holes and no nils an is randomized. It then hands off items from that bucket.

* Solve performance ideas
	* At each level, with some randomness (ideally weighted), diverge from DFS by changing which one we dive into and spin off the rest of the work items.

* Grid should suppot copy operations and have copy-on-write semantics with shared cells.

* Rate sudokus based on experienced difficulty. (See http://www.longwood.edu/assets/mathematics/Team2975_ProblemB.pdf)

* Analysis: Better aggregation of rank. This problem is called "Rank Aggregation" and can be Hard. http://www10.org/cdrom/papers/577/ seems to outline the most workable solution (MarkovChain4).
* Analysis: Run our difficulty grader on the real puzzles and see how well it fits with user perceived difficulty.
* Analysis: Throw out outliers for each individual user.
* Analysis: Throw out users who don't have a full range of difficulties in their history.
* Analysis: Build in plotting

* Investigate making better grids (fewer clues / more symmetry)
